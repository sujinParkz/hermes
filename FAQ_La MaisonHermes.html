                            <p>
                                Some of our items in precious materials (crocodile, alligator, lizard, etc.) cannot leave their country of purchase without a CITES certificate (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). Upon request, the certificate will be provided by your Hermès store and may require a few weeks to be established. The CITES certificate is valid for a limited period. You may need to renew your request with your local authorities if you wish to travel once again with your item. We invite you to check with local authorities whether any exceptions may apply.

                                The vast majority of Hermès products are crafted by us in France. All Hermès leather goods are handmade in France by 2,500 saddler-fine leather craftsmen in our manufactures. All of our silk items (ties and scarves in particular) are woven and printed in our manufactures in the Lyon region, the cradle of the silk trade. Hermès also draws on specific expertise, such as watchmaking in Switzerland, Mongolian cashmere, Vietnamese lacquer or Scottish wool.

                            <p>
                                When it comes to sustainable development, Hermès’ mission is to strengthen our corporate project around the authenticity of each product and the application of our house’s ethics to all aspects of our business. <br>
                                By authenticity, we especially mean respecting natural raw materials and developing artisanal skills, essentially in France. Formalized in a charter, our corporate ethics enhance Hermès’ relationships with its staff, suppliers, customers and shareholders. <br>
                                Hermès is an attentive, concerned and committed company which conducts its business in a way that respects its ecological, social, economic and cultural environment.

                            What is Hermès doing to combat counterfeiting?
                            <p>
                                The Hermès Group is very active in the fight against counterfeiting. <br>
                                A team of legal experts is responsible for protecting the Group"s creations and defending them against any violations. <br>
                                This team carries out many actions, which include both preventative measures (training and lobbying) and coercive measures (administrative, civil and criminal proceedings). <br>
                                These actions are implemented worldwide with special attention given to the Internet, which currently represents the primary vehicle for the sale of counterfeit products. <br>
                                You can help us in this fight by bringing any questionable websites to our attention ("Contact us" section).

                            <p>
                                In accordance with the applicable regulations, you have the right to request access, rectification, erasure and portability of your personal data, to restrict or oppose its processing.

                            <p>

Therefore, if you exercise any of the rights mentioned above, you will be asked to let us know which right you wish to exercise and to provide us with certain information so that we can identify you (for example: copy of an identity card, passport or other legally recognized identity document).

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you request access, rectification or deletion of your data, for example, we will provide you with the requested information as soon as possible after receipt of your request, but no later than one month. This period may be longer if your request is complex or occurs in a context justifying such an extension. We will inform you if this is the case. <br>
                                We will comply with your requests to the extent required by law; in some cases, we may be legally required or permitted to retain your data. In such a case, we will inform you.
