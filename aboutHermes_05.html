            SIX GENERATIONS <br>
            OF <br>
            ARTISANS
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since 1837, generation after generation, Hermès has followed a dual thread &#45; on the one hand the painstaking work of the craftsman in his workshop, and on the other the lifestyles of its customers. Carried by an enduring spirit of freedom and creativity, Hermès remains highly sensitive and attentive to the changing nature and needs of society.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The adventure began in Paris in 1837 when the harness-maker Thierry Hermès opened a workshop in rue Basse-du-Rempart. From the beginning, he understood and anticipated his customers’ expectations, their desire for simplicity and lightness in a city teeming with modern movement. His harnesses embodied discreet finesse as well as endurance in all conditions: a technical achievement that was recognized with an award at the Universal Exhibition of 1867.

                <p>
                    Charles-Émile Hermès, Thierry Hermès’ son, moved the workshops to 24 Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and opens a store. At this now-emblematic address, harnesses and saddles were made to measure. The house’s reputation for the excellence of its creations spread throughout Europe.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    During the interwar period, lifestyles changed and the house broke new ground under the management of Émile Hermès, son of Charles-Émile. Hermès offered items that met society’s needs, from saddlery and harnesses to leather goods. Émile Hermès had been inspired by a very simple idea that decisively changed the course of the family business. During a trip to Canada, he was fascinated by the American “close-all” opening and closing system on the hood of a military car. In 1922, he obtained the exclusive rights to this system, known today as the zip or zipper; and it came to be used on many of the house’s bags.
                    Throughout his life, Émile Hermès was an avid collector of works of art, books, objects and curiosities. The collection is constantly enriched by his successors and continues to be a source of inexhaustible inspiration for the house’s creations.

                </h3>
                <p> 
                    Émile Hermès was not only attached to his roots, but passionate about his era. Under his leadership, the house opened up to new métiers. In 1925, the first men’s ready-to-wear garment, a golf jacket, was created. To complement their customers’ looks, Hermès quickly introduced jewellery in 1927, followed by watches and sandals in 1928.

                <p>
                    With Jeu des omnibus et dames blanches, the famous silk scarf was born, the first of a long series created by Robert Dumas, Émile Hermès’ son-in-law.

                <p>
                    The creation of ties by Hermès is an illustration of the house’s entrepreneurial spirit. In Cannes, a number of gentlemen &#45; having been refused entry to the casino &#45; visited the neighbouring Hermès store in search of the requisite tie. This demand led the house to start producing this silk accessory, which became an essential element of the Hermès men’s wardrobe.

                <p>
                    As the father of four daughters, Émile Hermès passed the torch to his sons-in-law. One of them, Robert Dumas, took over from his father-in-law as head of the business in 1951. He was responsible for many of the house’s major successes, including the first silk scarf, the Kelly bag and the Chaîne d’ancre bracelet, which he was inspired to create while observing boats moored in Normandy.

                <p>
                    Designed by Robert Dumas in the 1930s, the history of this handbag took an unexpected turn in 1956 when a photograph of Grace Kelly carrying the bag was published around the world. It was the start of a success story, and the house named the bag Kelly in honour of the princess.

                <p>
                    At the beginning of the 1960s, Leïla Menchari, a graduate of the Beaux-Arts of Tunis and Paris, joined Annie Beaumel in designing the window displays of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré store. From 1978 onwards, Leïla Menchari pursued this bold and flamboyant creative work on her own until 2013, when Antoine Platteau, set designer and scenographer for theatre and cinema, took over the transformation of these window displays into little theatres of elegance.

                    More of a journal than a magazine, this publication was created in 1973 in Germany under the name Die Welt von Hermès, with Le Monde d’Hermès emerging in France two years later. Now translated into more than ten languages, Le Monde d’Hermès is distributed throughout the world.

                <p>
                    From 1978 onwards, Robert Dumas’ son, Jean-Louis, gradually revolutionised the house of Hermès. A visionary, curious about all things and all cultures, he diversified and projected the house onto the world map. Hermès embraced new métiers founded on unique know-how, such as watchmaking in 1978 &#45; which operated under the name La Montre Hermès. In 1976, Hermès opened up to the art of shoe manufacturing with the bootmaker John Lobb; followed by the integration of Puiforcat silversmiths in 1993 and the Saint-Louis crystalworks in 1995.

                    The Birkin bag was the outcome of a chance encounter between Jean-Louis Dumas and the actress and singer Jane Birkin on a Paris to London flight which led to Jean-Louis Dumas designing her ideal bag. Elegant and voluminous, for evening or daytime &#45; the Birkin bag was born.

                    A memorable fireworks display over the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris marked the 150th anniversary of Hermès. This celebration launched the first annual theme in a tradition that has been perpetuated ever since to nourish all forms of creativity with a shared source of inspiration.

                    The leather workshops moved from the first floor of 24 rue Faubourg Saint-Honoré to Pantin, just outside Paris. The architecture of the new site offered a bright and spacious workspace for the artisans. The site was extended in 2013 with the Cité des métiers, a major project encompassing several buildings linked by five themed gardens. Led by the architects RDAI, the operation received the Prix de l’Équerre silver award in 2014.

                    OPENING OF A MAISON HERMÈS IN NEW YORK
                </h3>
                <p>
                    With Jean-Louis Dumas still at the helm, Hermès developed across the world with the opening of numerous stores, each of which ingeniously combined the saddler’s identity with local culture. Among these international stores, several Maisons Hermès were inaugurated: on Madison Avenue in New York (USA) in 2000, in a building made of glass bricks designed by Renzo Piano in Ginza, Tokyo (Japan) in 2001, and in Dosan Park, Seoul (Korea) in 2006. Hermès also launched an e-commerce website in the United States in 2002, then another in France three years later.

                    Sixth generation family member, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, son of Jean-Louis, was appointed artistic director of Hermès. Creativity became ever more abundant within the different métiers, bringing innovation and imagination together. The house expanded its range of know-how, complementing its jewellery product offer with a first Haute Bijouterie collection in 2010. The following year, the home universe launched home furnishing fabrics and wallpapers for the first time. Hermès Horizons designed unique and bespoke objects, while the Apple Watch Hermès bore witness to a bold and innovative partnership with Apple, initiated in 2015.

                <p>
                    At the request of Jean-Louis Dumas, the continued development of the business was undertaken by Patrick Thomas, his former right-hand man and Managing Director of the group from 2003 to 2006. He decentralised the strategic organisation of the métiers and reorganised Hermès’ presence across the world into geographical regions. Patrick Thomas also ensured the transition between the two generations, until the appointment of Axel Dumas, nephew of Jean-Louis Dumas, as Executive Chairman in 2013.

                <p> 
                    At the initiative of Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the house added a new dimension to its patronage policy and philanthropic commitment with the launch of the Fondation d’entreprise Hermès. In keeping with the artisanal and humanist values of the family company, the foundation works mainly in the fields of creation, the transmission of know-how, the preservation of the planet and solidarity through its own support programmes, both in France and abroad. Though diverse, the activity of the Foundation is motivated a single conviction: what we do creates who we are.

                    The petit h workshop was created under the leadership of Pascale Mussard, niece of Jean-Louis Dumas, and adopts a unique approach within the house, that of creation in reverse. Starting with unused materials from Hermès manufactures, artisans and designers give free rein to their inventiveness to create unique and unexpected objects, building on the exceptional know-how of the house.

                    Appointed Executive Chairman in 2013, Axel Dumas, nephew of Jean-Louis Dumas, has strengthened the dynamic growth of the group with the inauguration of the fifth Maison Hermès in Shanghai in 2014 and the opening of many stores worldwide. In 2019, Hermès arrived in Poland, establishing its first store in Warsaw. Axel Dumas has also driven the implementation of the group’s digital strategy, which culminated in the redesign of the hermes.com website in 2017. He has taken Hermès into the new technological era, in keeping with the expectations of customers who are becoming more and more connected. Under his leadership, the group is stepping up the omnichannel dynamic within the organisation.

Hermès continues to assert its independence thanks to a family-based shareholding structure committed to retaining most of its production in France and perpetuating its know-how to serve creativity.
