                            Where can I purchase Hermès leather goods?
                            <p>
                                Hermès leather goods may be purchased exclusively in Hermès stores and on the Hermès website, with the exception of the Kelly and Birkin lines, which are sold exclusively in our bricks-and-mortar stores (addresses available on fr.stores.hermes.com). Due to the high number of requests for these objects, it is possible that the model you are seeking is not available. We invite you to contact our sales consultants, who will be able to help you, or Customer Service.

                            <p>
                                All of our products are created by hand by our artisans, according to very strict quality criteria, and mastering Hermès expertise requires many years. We work primarily with leather, a natural material and a resource limited by Hermès’ strict selection criteria. For all of these reasons, several months are required to create an Hermès leather good.

                                We kindly invite you to visit one of our physical boutiques of your choice. One of our agents will have the pleasure to let you discover our frangrances and offer you a sample if available.

                                We will continue providing exchanges and refunds, once the packages have been received and checked by our quality department. <br>
                                The reimbursement periods from the article 11.1 of our general conditions of sale are provided for information only. Current circumstances may disrupt our logistic activities and delivery operations, and refund operations may encounter possible delays.

                            <p>
                                Belts are sized in centimeters. In order to determine your Hermès belt size, we recommend measuring one of your own belts from the base of the tongue to the hole you use most. You can also measure your waist circumference at the point where you normally position your belts. For example, if your waist measures 85 cm, your Hermès belt size would be 85.

                                Apple warrants the included Apple-branded hardware product and Apple-branded accessories against defects in materials and workmanship for two years from the date of original retail purchase. Apple does not warrant against normal wear and tear, nor damage caused by accident or abuse. To obtain service, call Apple or visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider—available service options are dependent on the country in which service is requested and may be restricted to the original country of sale. Call charges and international shipping charges may apply, depending on the location. Subject to the full terms and detailed information on obtaining service available at www.apple.com/ca/legal/warranty and www.apple.com/ca/support, if you submit a valid claim under this warranty, Apple will either repair, replace, or refund your hardware product at its own discretion.

                                Hermès Watch Band Warranty <br>
                                Hermès shall deliver to the customer a watch band that is free from manufacturing defects at the time of delivery, that is to say that the product will be fit for the normal use expected for this kind of product and will have the features set out at the time of the order and its acceptance. This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, or any damage resulting from an accident, negligence, or improper handling. Nor does it apply, on a more general basis, if there is evidence of improper use or misuse. This warranty may only be exercised on condition that the customer does so within the statutory period applicable to the country of purchase as from the delivery of the goods. Any quality claim concerning a watch band must be addressed to the Hermès store of the purchase or to any Hermès store, the address of which can be found at the following link: https://www.hermes.com/uk/en/find-store/. If a valid claim is submitted, the customer may choose to have the watch band repaired or replaced, or may request a credit, unless one of these choices leads to a patently disproportionate cost for Hermès. The repair or replacement of a watch band will occur at no cost to the customer and shall be without prejudice to possible damages in the event that the customer should be entitled to such.

                            <p>
                                Our workshops are able to respond to numerous repair and refurbishment requests for Hermès products. We invite you to visit your nearest Hermès store to have your object examined by one of our sales consultants. They will then provide an estimate and waiting period for the planned repair. For any questions, please contact our Customer Service department by telephone or email via the “Contact us” page or visit one of our stores.

                            How do I care for my Hermès bag or leather good?
                            <p>
                                Leather is a living material that evolves, changes colour, softens, and becomes patinated over time. It should be protected from humidity and prolonged exposure to light or extreme heat. It is not recommended to use care products available on the market that are not adapted to Hermès leathers. The best way to maintain your bag is to regularly return it to our workshops to be cleaned and, if needed, restitched and repolished.

                            What warranty does my Hermès watch have?
                            <p>
                                Your Hermès Warranty has a two (2) year worldwide cover once your International Warranty booklet is filled in, dated and signed by the retailer on the day of purchase of your Hermès watch. <br>
                                The benefits given to you by our Hermès Warranty are in addition to other rights and remedies you may have under your country’s consumer law in relation to the Hermès watch to which the Warranty relates. Our Hermès Warranty does not exclude, restrict or modify any statutory rights or remedies which cannot be excluded. <br>
                                During the applicable Hermès Warranty period of two (2) years, Hermès will make good any production fault by repairing or replacing the affected watch or part thereof, provided that notice of any claimed defect has been given to Hermès within the warranty period (2 years). <br>

                            <p>
                                Saddle leather is a living material that evolves, changes colour, softens, and becomes patinated over time. It should be protected and maintained with care. <br>
                                Please do not hesitate to visit the dedicated page for more information or to contact our experts for any assistance.

                            <p>
                                Although it is highly resistant, precious metals and naturel stones are sensitive to their environment. <br>
                                In general, we recommend that you remove your jewellery before any activity that may damage it : sport, swimming pool or beach, but also housekeeping, gardening and DIY. <br>
                                Beware of shocks, which cause marks and scratches of varying depth. Similarly, several pieces of jewellery worn or stored in contact with each other may scratch or catch one another. <br>
                                Finally, to slow down the natural oxidation effect, avoid exposing your jewellery to moisture, intense heat, and contrasts in temperature. Make it a habit to remove your jewellery before washing your hands, and for example before a sauna or steam room session.
                            </p>

                                Once you have made your choice, the saddle will be crafted by a single artisan in our workshop based at 24 Rue de Faubourg Saint Honoré. It will be delivered to you within 3 to 4 months. <br>

                                Apple Watch Hermès shares the same number as your iPhone. When you receive a phone call and your Apple Watch is set up and powered on, it rings whether or not your iPhone is nearby.
